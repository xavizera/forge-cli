## Introduction

[Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com) is a server management and site deployment service. After connecting to your preferred server provider, Forge will provision a new server, installing and configuring: PHP, Nginx, MySQL, and more.

In addition, Forge can assist you in managing scheduled jobs, queue workers, SSL certificates, and more. After a server has provisioned, you can then deploy your PHP / Laravel applications or WordPress applications using the Forge UI dashboard or the Forge CLI.
